============================================================
Postgresql instance

1)download pstools
where>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb842062.aspx

2)create folder
for new instance postgres database.
example:
C:\Program Files\OpenERP 7.0-20150803\PostgreSQL\data
is for default database location and default config

new folder for database location and config for new postgresql


3)give permission with "network service"
   -> go to folder property
   ->tab security
   ->'click'>>edit
   ->'click'>>add
   ->'type'>>network service
   ->'click'>>check name (must be correct)
   ->'click'>>ok

4)create user like super user (postgres)right
    -> open cmd
    -> go to bin (C:\Program Files\OpenERP 7.0-20150803\PostgreSQL\bin)
    -> psql -U superuser postgres
       psql -U openpg postgres
    -> \du (list user-list)
    -> create user peneil1 with superuser createrole createdb replication;
    ->\q (exit)


5)enter to folder of PSTools with cmd (cmd with admin right)
   ->'click' start button
   ->'search' cmd at search programs and files
   ->'right click' Run as admin
   ->'go to pstool folder'

6)run psexec -i -u "nt authority\network service" cmd.exe
   ->'Click' install(inital state, no need for next time)
 
   -> happen >> new prompt will appear


7) go to C:\Program Files\OpenERP 7.0-20150803\PostgreSQL\bin

8)initdb -U peneil -E UTF8 "C:\Program Files\OpenERP 7.0-20150803\PostgreSQL\data2"
read more for initdb at
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/app-initdb.html

   -> to understand

      1) -U peneil
      peneil is new super user for my case

      2) -E UTF8 is format for database

      3) "C:\Program Files\OpenERP 7.0-20150803\PostgreSQL\data2" is folder path in step 2

9)exit prompt (prompt that appear in step 6 and also ran step 7)
 plz exit all of prompt that used in

10) change port at new folder (step 2)
yes, we have to change some config under path of it
C:\Program Files\OpenERP 7.0-20150803\PostgreSQL\data2
  --> copy postgresql.conf to Desktop
  --> search with 'port' and change to 5433 (5432 is default port)
it is to run new instance

11)open cmd with admin right and go to bin under postgres

12)pg_ctl register -N pg_test3 -U "nt authority\network service" -D "C:\Program Files\OpenERP 7.0-20150803\PostgreSQL\data3"
to understand
pg_ctl is registering your new postgresql as service
-N pg_test3 is service name
-U "nt authority\network service" as logon user right
-D "C:\Program Files\OpenERP 7.0-20150803\PostgreSQL\data2"
 is path of data that you want to register


13)net start pg_test
 start service

14)psql -U peneil -h localhost -p 5433 postgres
-U peneil is superuser that you registed
-p 5433 is port that used in data3
